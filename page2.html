    <p>Frustrated with the lack of film developing stations and photo labs in the city of Chicago, former Kellogg MBA student Luis Blucher decided to use the knowledge he had gained in business school to set-up a new venture in the photography market in early 2021.</p>
    <p>What started out with a hobby and side-projected ended transforming into a business opportunity as soon as orders started pouring in. Fed up with corporate life, Luis decided to fully commit to his project and with that Film Depot Co. was born.</p>
